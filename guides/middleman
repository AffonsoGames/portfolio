	<h3 style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;text-align: left">General</h3>
	<p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;text-align: left">A middleman is a reputable third party in a transaction who is there to ensure the quality and security of a transaction. A middleman in the context of MC-Market typically has approximately 50 reputation, and holds one or both items, verifies the validity then forwards the items after the transaction is completed. A middleman will usually have a thread up in the "Middleman" section. All middleman should have a terms of service voiding them of any liability in the transaction, else they put themselves at risk. The majority of middlemen will not hold money in PayPal as it leaves them at risk for chargebacks. Deals that use a middleman will usually be held on MCMarket, though if they are not, the middleman will verify the identity of the users in the transaction, typically through a PM.</p>

	<h3 style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;text-align: left">Other Information</h3>
	<p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;text-align: left">For deals not listed, use a similar process of verifying authenticity, removing 2FA systems and changing the login info. Make sure to have a solid thread design and terms of service to make sure you both get clients and those clients don't screw you over. Keep your fees below 10% of the transactional cost, if you do fees. Inform your clients if you see any risks and be very communicative. Generally, just be respectful and insightful to your clients, be a neutral party and you are sure to see great results!</p>
