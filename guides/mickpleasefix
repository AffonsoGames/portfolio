		<p style="font-family: 'Raleway', serif;textalign: center"><b>1.</b> Profile Pictures are not uploading correctly. Profile pictures will not upload. Likely a storage issue. Seems to be a reoccuring issue.<br><b>2.</b> Name colors are not being saved when they are changed. Problem since Make-a-Wish Gradient Purple name color was released. Likely related to the profile picture issue.<br><b>3.</b> Justis R is already has enough to do, hire some more scam resolvers. They have been a problem for months, figure it out.</p>
